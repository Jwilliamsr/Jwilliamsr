### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Jesse.

I'm a builder and operator who's spent my career brining open source developer tools to market. My career in tech was launched after helping to co-found YouCaring.com, which led to a string of acquisitions (x3) and leadership roles at Red hat/IBM, AWS, and Docker. 
My past proejcts include:

- YouCaring.com (acquired by GoFundMe)
- Codenvy.io (acquired by Red hat)
- ExecVision.io (acquired by MediaFly)

Today, I spend most of time working on [Jozu](https://jozu.com), contributing to open source [KitOps](https://kitops.ml), and helping early-stage, VC-backed companies differentiate themselves and communicate value through [Stori](https://GoStori.com). 

If you're interested in following along with my journey, check out [my Twitter/X account](https://x.com/friendscallmejw) where I share my random thoughts.

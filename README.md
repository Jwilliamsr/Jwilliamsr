### Hi there 👋 my name is Jesse.

I'm a builder and operator who's spent my career brining open source developer tools to market. My career in tech was launched after helping to co-found YouCaring.com, which led to a string of acquisitions (x3) and leadership roles at Red hat/IBM, AWS, and Docker. 
My past proejcts include:

- YouCaring.com (acquired by GoFundMe)
- Codenvy.io (acquired by Red hat)
- ExecVision.io (acquired by MediaFly)

I've also played key roles in messaging Red Hat's acquisition by IBM to the Red Hat Developer community, growing adoption and awareness of open source Eclipse Che, and orchestrating a joing GTM for AWS' Container, Kubernetes, and Serverless products. 

Today, I spend most of time working on [Jozu](https://jozu.com) and contributing to open source [KitOps](https://kitops.ml).

If you're interested in following along with my journey, check out [my Twitter/X account](https://x.com/friendscallmejw) where I share my random thoughts.
